# List App

This is a personal app that keeps track of tasks and important duties. It is designed to be simple, fast, and very quick to navigate.
Other apps that fulfill this role often are too complicated with different features, resulting in additional time being taken to read the information, 
create new tasks, or otherwise use the app. This app will limit the features to the bare esssentials, making it take minimal time to complete its task.

This project is still in progress and has many more features that need to be implemented, but has basic functionalities implemented.

# Planned Features

- Online information storage
- Nicer looking UI
- Better organization of tasks

# Building from Source
